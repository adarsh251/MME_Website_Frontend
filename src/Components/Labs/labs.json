It demonstrates how heat pipes utilize phase change materials to transfer heat over long distances with minimal temperature difference. In this apparatus, heat is applied to one end of the heat pipe, causing the working fluid inside to evaporate. The vapor then travels to the cooler end, where it condenses and releases the absorbed heat. The condensed liquid returns to the hot end through capillary action, and the cycle repeats. The system allows for the comparison of heat transfer efficiency between a heat pipe and other materials with high conductivity, such as copper. By using temperature sensors at various points along the heat pipe, the demonstrator illustrates the heat pipe’s ability to transfer heat more effectively than traditional conductors, making it ideal for use in electronics, spacecraft, and energy systems."
