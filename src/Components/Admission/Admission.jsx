      <img className="admission-chapter-image" src={asme} alt="asme" />
      <p className="admission-chapter-text">The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) is a global professional organization that, according to its mission, "advances the art, science, and practice of engineering and allied disciplines" through "ongoing education, training, professional development, standards, research, conferences, publications, government relations, and other outreach efforts." ASME serves as an engineering society, standards body, research and development entity, advocacy group, education provider, and non-profit organization. Originally focused on mechanical engineering in North America, ASME has since become multidisciplinary and global in scope</p>
      <p className="admission-chapter-text">The ASME student chapter at LNMIIT is a student-driven community, designed by and for students. Its main goal is to prepare students with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate the competitive challenges of the industrial and corporate sectors. ASME, LNMIIT supports this diverse technical community through high-quality programs in continuing education, standards, conferences, publications, and research.</p>
      <h2 className="admission-chapter-title">SAE</h2>
      <img className="admission-chapter-image" src={sae} alt="sae" />
      <p className="admission-chapter-text">The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) chapter at LNMIIT Jaipur, established in October 2015, was founded through the collaborative efforts of a group of students eager to complement the theoretical knowledge learned in classrooms with practical engineering experience. Their vision of cultivating an automotive culture transformed the institute, with SAE LNMIIT Jaipur starting with over 50 student members and 6 faculty members. One of the chapterâ€™s key strengths is its diversity, with students from nearly every department of the institute.</p>
      <p className="admission-chapter-text">We firmly believe that any passionate student at the institute can become an active member of this chapter. It offers a platform for students to expand their engineering knowledge through enhanced interaction at all levels, facilitated by group activities, lectures, workshops, brainstorming sessions, and various institute-wide competitions. We envision SAE LNMIIT Jaipur as a strong unifying force connecting the industry, the institute, and most importantly, the students.</p>
